Pandas Challenge Observations: 

1. The vast majority of players are in their 20's and but the biggest spenders are in their mid-thirties. 

2. The majority of players are men but females tend to spend, on average, more than men on purchases. 

3. The highest number of games purchased is 13, which means there is a large sample of games that make up all 780 purchases.
